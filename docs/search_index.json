At the end of this section, you will document an initial research question or idea and associated data needed to address that question, that you may want to explore while pursuing this course. 3 Learning Objectives At the end of this activity, you will be able to: 3.1 USA-NPN Project Mission &amp; Design: The USA National Phenology Network (USA-NPN) collects, organizes, and shares phenological data and information to aid decision-making, scientific discovery, and a broader understanding of phenology from a diversity of perspectives. The USA National Phenology Network consists of a National Coordinating Office (NCO), thousands of volunteer observers and many partners, including research scientists, resource managers, educators, and policy-makers. Anyone who participates in Nature’s Notebook or collaborates with NCO staff to advance the science of phenology or to inform decisions is part of the USA-NPN. 3.2 Vision &amp; Mission USA-NPN’s vision is to provide data and information on the timing of seasonal events in plants and animals to ensure the well-being of humans, ecosystems, and natural resources. To support this and its mission the USA-NPN collects, organizes, and shares phenological data and information to aid decision-making, scientific discovery, and a broader understanding of phenology from a diversity of perspectives. 3.2.1 Relevant documents &amp; background information: USA-NPN Strategic Plan USA-NPN Information Sheet: Tracking seasonal changes to support science, natural resource management, and society 2019 USA-NPN Annual Report 3.3 USA-NPN’s Spatial design: As a citizen-science based platform, the spatial sampling of USA-NPN data is opportunistic, since observations are contributed voluntarily by citizen scientist participants. 3.4 Types of USA-NPN Data: Observational - As described in USA National Phenology Network Observational Data Documentation (Rosemartin et al. 2018) Status/intensity Individual phenometrics Site-level phenometrics Gridded data products - As described in USA National Phenology Network gridded products documentation (Crimmins et al. 2017) Pheno-Forecast products - As described in “Short-term forecasts of insect phenology inform pest management” (Crimmins et al. 2020) Example of USA-NPN’s Buffel Grass Pheno-Forecast for Arizona. 3.5 How to Access USA-NPN Data: Summary here 3.5.1 The USA-NPN Landing page A concise list of all available NPN data sets, tools, products. 3.5.2 APIs This is a set of standard web service calls that allows for programmatic access to NPN data independent of any particular programming language. 3.5.3 Rnpn package This suite of R functions allows for programmatic access to both gridded and in-situ NPN data sets in an R environment. Full documentation available here: https://usa-npn.github.io/rnpn/ 3.5.4 Phenology Observation Portal (for observational data) This tool allows for users to download customized datasets of observational data from the National Phenology Database, which includes phenology data collected via the Nature’s Notebook phenology program (2009-present for the United States), and additional integrated datasets, such as historical lilac and honeysuckle data (1955-present). Filters are available to specify dates, regions, species and phenophases of interest. This provides access to all phenometrics, which represents varying degrees of data aggregation. Geospatial Request Builder (for raster data and image files) This tool simplifies the process of accessing NPN gridded data through standard WMS and WCS services. WMS services provide the data as basic graphic images, such as PNGs or TIFFs, whereas WCS services provide the same data in formats accessible to GIS applications. ### Visualization Tool The Visualization Tool provides an easier way to explore phenology data and maps. The user-friendly interface is intended to allow for searching for comparing general trends and quick-and-easy access to map data/products. 3.6 Exercises 3.6.1 Computational 3.6.1 Written Question 1: How might or does USA-NPN intersect with your current research or future career goals? (1 paragraph) Question 2: Question 4: Intro to USA-NPN Culmination Activity Write up a 1-page summary of a project that you might want to explore using USA-NPN data over the duration of this course. Include the types of USA-NPN (and other data) that you will need to implement this project. Save this summary as you will be refining and adding to your ideas over the course of the semester. "]
