Hi, I'm Dr. Katharyn Duffy.  I have a Ph.D in Earth Science from Northern Arizona University.  Over the past two years I've worked as an open-source software engineer in the PhenoCam lab, and now I'm the coding and lab support for your course.  I really look forward to working with all of you!

Hi, I'm Rohan David Boone. I am a second-year Ph.D student in the T3 Ecoinformatics program. I have a BS in Plant Biology with an emphasis in Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics. I'm currently studying tree and forest "memory" in Kiona Ogle's lab using Bayesian statistical models.
