Hi, I'm Dr. Katharyn Duffy.  I have a Ph.D in Earth Science from Northern Arizona University.  Over the past two years I've worked as an open-source software engineer in the PhenoCam lab, and now I'm the coding and lab support for your course.  I really look forward to working with all of you!

Hi, I'm Paul Roman. I am a second year ecoinformatics PhD student in the Carbone/Richardson Lab. My research interest is in studying ecosystem carbon cycles with a specific focus on movement of carbon between the soil and the atmosphere through processes such as soil respiration.
