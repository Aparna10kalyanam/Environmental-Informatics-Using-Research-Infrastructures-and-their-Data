Hi, I'm Dr. Katharyn Duffy.  I have a Ph.D in Earth Science from Northern Arizona University.  Over the past two years I've worked as an open-source software engineer in the PhenoCam lab, and now I'm the coding and lab support for your course.  I really look forward to working with all of you!

Hi, I'm Ethan Yackulic. I received a Masters in Environmental Science & Policy from NAU and have spent the past two years working for USGS, located here in Flagstaff. Most recently, I have worked with plant ecologists to identify how cost partitioning affects success in ecological restoration projects in the state of Utah. I'm a first year PhD student in the T3 program working with Nick McKay (Geology/EnvSci) to develop techniques for processing hyperspectral images of lake sediment cores that may shed light on long term changes in climate and water quality.
