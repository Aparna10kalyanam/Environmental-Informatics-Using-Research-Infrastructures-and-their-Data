Hi, I'm Dr. Katharyn Duffy.  I have a Ph.D in Earth Science from Northern Arizona University.  Over the past two years I've worked as an open-source software engineer in the PhenoCam lab, and now I'm the coding and lab support for your course.  I really look forward to working with all of you!

Hello! I'm Emma Reich. I have a BS in Molecular Environmental Biology from UC Berkeley and a background in plant ecophysiology and stable isotope analysis. I also used to work as a field tech for NEON. I'm a first year PhD student in the T3 program in Kiona Ogle's lab and I'm interested in evapotranspiration partitioning and Bayesian analysis.

Hi everyone! I'm Melissa (Mel) Rose. I am a first year Ecoinformatics PhD student in Teki's lab. I received my BS in Environmental Sciences with a focus in Conservation Biology from UCLA. During my undergraduate research, I modeled wildlife corridors for Sequioa and Kings Canyon National Park. For the past two years, I worked as a Science Assistant at NSF in the Division of Biological Infrastructure (DBI) supporting the NEON and BIO Centers programs. I am also looking forward to working with you all and to get some more hands-on experience using NEON data!
